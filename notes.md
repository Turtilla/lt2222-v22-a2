### Part 1
For implementing randomness in the sample_lines() function I made use of the [random] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module from the Python Standard Library. Using the randint() function from that module, I generate a number Y from 0 to X, where X is the total number of lines minus the desired number of lines. Then I use that generated number Y to be the start of the slice, and that number Y plus the desired number of lines as the end. _Note that the constraint on generating the number Y is due to it otherwise potentially leading to an IndexError if Y + desired number of lines exceeded the length of the file, so to say._
