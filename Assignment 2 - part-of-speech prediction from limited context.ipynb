    "# Assignment 2 - part-of-speech prediction from limited context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will train classifiers that attempt, within a window of five words, to make a binary prediction about whether the third word belongs to a given part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb), but using very limited information -- that is, the last two letters of the first, second, fourth, and fifth word of the sequence, and no information whatsoever directly from the third word itself.  You will strip out all punctuation (using the NLTK `WordPunctTokenizer`), lowercase, and remove stop words (using the NLTK English stop words list).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you will predict over samples that have two classes, P and not-P, where P is the selected part of speech to classify.  For example, from the sentence, \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\", we can select the following 5-word windows without stop words, \"brown fox jumped lazy dog\" and \"quick brown fox jumped lazy\".  If we select verbs as the part-of-speech we are classifying over, we get the instances <(wn,ox,zy,og),1>, since \"jumped\" is a verb, but <(ck,wn,ed,zy),0> because \"fox\" in that context is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you will need to take into account the position of the last-two-letter feature:  \"zy\" as the fourth word's last two letters is different from \"zy\" as the fifth word's last two letters.  They are two features, say, `zy_4` and `zy_5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will likely not actually work.  But it might!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create training and testing samples according to this procedure, and you will build a data structure that can be fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.  You will train the classifier on the training data and evaluate it on the testing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The work will be done in a .py module file in the same folder as this notebook.  **No modifications to this notebook will be graded.** We will run your module using this notebook or one we modify that you won't see in order to test your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file you must create and add to the github repo is `mycode.py`, which will be imported here.  You can create your own notebooks or scripts to test it.  You can put any number of your own helper functions and also put optional parameters on any of the python functions mentioned here. You should also create a Markdown file, `notes.md`, to keep any **concise** notes and remarks about the assignment.  The code must run on mltgpu.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is due Monday, 2022 March 7, at 23:59. There are 33 points and 5 bonus points.**"
